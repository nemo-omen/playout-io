# Playout.io

## Excessively simple graphics playout

Like, really, really simple. This is going to be a quick and dirty express/socket.io server with two routes. One route, `/` will be a list of available graphics. The other route `/playout` will be where the graphics show up once they've been played.

At the moment, because I need to have something working in, like, a day, it's going to be some (not wuite) MVP business.
